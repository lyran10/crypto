In the chart the given information is as per the duration for example in the last 24 hours how many times it changed and when it changed and what was the price. There are four durations 24 hours, 30 days, 3 months, 1 year.
In the left hand side at the bottom there is a button which can be used when a user will create an account and will be logged in. After logging in a user can create a watchlist in which he can store the coins that he wants to keep a track on.
